# Study_Tracker

In this busy world we need to master so many skills.We have to manage the available time to study different subject and aquiring new skills.
Everyday we put our best efforts to study different subjects.But when we look back at the end of the day or week we feel that we should 
have put more effort to reach particular goal even though we have put enough effort. This will result in lack of confidence and interest
to study.
     To overcome all this what if we have some way to measure the time spent on studying each subject.Yes we can get the total time 
by mannually noting the time and by adding it at the end of the day or week.
     But how it feels to have a button which you will on while studying and off it once finished. And it gives you the report of your total
and average time spent on each subject whenever you ask.
     You don not have to worry about how to implement that button. It is the work ok the Study Tracker android application. Simply you add 
the subject of your choice and when you want to study long press the subject name in the list to on it when finished just long press again 
to off it. You can ask for daily, weekly and overall report for total and average time spent on each subject.
Bar charts and pie charts available for easy visualization and comparision.
